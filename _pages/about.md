I am a third-year Ph.D. student in international relations at Columbia University, with a focus on international political economy. My research examines the political motivations and behaviors of firms. I am interested in exploring the effects of firm-level activity on climate policy, as well as gender inequality in the developing world. 

I received my B.A. as a double major in honors political science and economics from Swarthmore College, where I was a McCabe Scholar. Prior to starting graduate school at Columbia, I she was a consultant at Oliver Wyman in New York City, focusing on financial regulation and climate investment. I also previously served as a Fellow at the World Economic Forum as part of the Financing the Transition to a Net-Zero Future Initiative.
