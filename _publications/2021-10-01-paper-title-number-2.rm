Abstract: The widespread consensus is that the climate crisis cannot be solved by public capital alone. A successful and sustainable transition requires the mobilization of private capital. While the global financial community is rising to this challenge, an investment gap remains due to supply- and demandside finance issues. On the supply side, firms, especially non-investment grade counterparties, looking to deploy breakthrough technologies have highlighted difficulties in securing affordable financing. Capital is either too expensive, shortdated or not flowing sufficiently. This is driven by a mismatch of financier risk appetite and inadequate de-risking. On the demand side, investors flag the lack of “bankable” opportunities and a limited pipeline. These issues are further exacerbated by policy/regulatory uncertainty, limited clarity and granularity on transition pathways and a lack of data to inform decisions and track progress. This report discusses three fundamental findings that help overcome key challenges by solving for increased bankability through replicable blueprints and collective action.
